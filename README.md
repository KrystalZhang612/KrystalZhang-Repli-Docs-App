# KrystalZhang-RepliDocs App
(Full-Stack Development) My replica to Google Docs App using Flutter, also using Node.js, Express Sockets, MongoDB, Riverpod, and various techniques. The replica application contains methods of authenticating users with Google, keeping users logged in, creating RestAPI to create and display new documents, building a powerful routing system to share documents links, and establishing socket connection to allow users to collaborate.

# Method to Run & Test the Project Locally
### Download the entire project to the local directory. 
### Open the project with Vscode. 
### Download needed dependencies, extension tools and MongoDB from [README](https://github.com/KrystalZhang612/KrystalZhang-Repli-Docs-App/blob/main/README.md). 
### Use command  `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or  `ipconfig getifaddr en1` in the local device terminal to obtain your local private ip address. 
### Replace `<your ip address>` in [`repli_docs_app/lib/constants.dart`](https://github.com/KrystalZhang612/KrystalZhang-Repli-Docs-App/blob/main/repli_docs_app/lib/constants.dart) with your own ip address. 
### Open 2 different Vscode terminals. 
### In terminal 1: use `cd repli_docs_app` to locate the App root. 
### In terminal 2: use `cd server` to locate to `index.js`, `node.js` server.
In [Thunder Client extension](https://www.thunderclient.com/), send a new POST request at http://localhost:3001/api/signup with the JSON body filling out with: 
```bash
{
  "name": "YOUR OWN USERNAME FROM MONGODB", 
  "email": "YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM MONGODB", 
  "profilePic": "YOUR OWN PASSWORD FROM MONGODB"
}
```
### Run `npm run dev` in node terminal until it returns ‚Äúconnection successful‚Äù.
### Then run `flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000`
### Have fun testing the replica of Google Docs Clone -> RepliDocs App!
